Francois' father Louis had owned multiple plots in Chablis before selling them off in the 1950s during the region's decline in popularity. By the 1960s, Francois saw renewed potential in Chablis wines, and decided to expand his holdings into grand cru parcels. As a result of these purchases and his experience as a fine grape grower, Raveneau earned a reputation as a premium winemaker by the end of the 1970s. After years of encouragement from the international community to open up his wine sales for export, Raveneau finally expanded into the international market for the first time in the 1980s.

The earliest evidence of the firm's activity as a Port shipper dates from 1678, coincidentally the year of the first ever recorded shipments of Port wine. The company was originally known as Phayre & Bradley after its founding partners and took its present name in 1736 when it was joined by John Croft, a member of an old and distinguished family of Yorkshire wine merchants. The Croft family played a prominent and influential role in the Port wine trade and elevated the House of Croft to the place of distinction which it occupies to this day. In 1911 the House of Croft was acquired by the Gilbeys, the distinguished English wine trade family. It is now owned and run by descendants of two old Port wine families, the Yeatmans and Fladgates. The place of distinction occupied by Croft and its wines is due in no small measure to its ownership of one of the finest estates of the Douro Valley, the famous Quinta da Roeda.","fullurl":"/producers/portugal-/croft","level":"3","parentIdPath":"|3|23|"},{"categories":[],"internalid":"345","name":"Dow's","sequencenumber":"3","displayinsite":true,"custrecord_external_url":"","custrecord_category_sort_option":"","custrecord_hide_in_navigation":"T","custrecord_category_type":"2","custrecord_region_under_producer":"F","custrecord_producer_image_url":"","custrecord_category_description":"\"From his new home in London, Bruno da Silva began importing wine to England from his native Portugal in 1789, thus beginning Dow's long history as a Port house.

The fruit for their 4,000-case production is sourced from the finest vineyards on the far side of the Cascade Mountains, and the Golitzins are meticulous in their oversight of the viticultural practices.
